# The Inspiration
I wanted to create a DVD Logo when I followed a tutorial about a bouncing object that would reverse it's position once it hit the edge of the bottom of the canvas screen. I realised I could definitely build a DVD logo style RMIT Logo that would bounce around in a small tv screen box.

# The Process

At first this idea was a little complicated, despite following several tutorials on how to build a DVD Logo in p5js I couldn't quite find one that made sense to me, so I changed up my idea, I looked into the knowledge I already knew from capagrego's tutorials, if statements can be set so that the axis of an object bounces off in reverse, this was perfect for creating an image of an icon that could bounce off of walls and corners

Using the if statements to tell the image to move in reverse the second it touches a point of the axis creates this really interesting and similar movement that a dvd logo makes when it bounces off of the walls of the television screen, I also adjusted the screen size so that it bounced off a set tv instead of the whole canvas.

I now struggled with a new problem, it bounced but it didn't change colours just like the dvd logo would do on television sets. Fortunately, there were plenty of p5js library resources on how to make a functions that chooses things, and how to set RGB. With this I built a function that picks an RGB colour when the conditions are met.

Then I jumped into my if statements and simply included that when the if statement is met, it changes the colour using the "pickRGB" function

This was a better success than I could have hoped, it was very straightforward and ended up with this result to input into my p5 sketch.
