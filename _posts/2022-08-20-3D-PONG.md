# The idea, successes and failures
I had this idea while designing my P5 Sketch and building the code I need for my "Never ending Pong battle", I wanted to instead bring the sketch into the 3D Plane, rather than a usual 2D Format we all know with Pong. However, I ran into a bit of trouble.

You see that while I have a 3D Plane, and have placed the graphical elements in the areas I want them, I unfortunately couldn't work out what was needed to bring the 3d ball from one 3d paddle to the other, WebGL works on a more complicated style of canvas, I wanted it to sit as a WebGL canvas WITHIN a WebGL canvas but of course in order to do this I needed to give it a "canvas2." to tell the program what kind of canvas I want this line of code to sit within.

The next big issue was WebGL being essentially like it's own set of rules for declaring variables, writing the lines of code can also be different, it became quite a harsh learning curve that in the end I couldn't quite work within the 3D axis of the canvas in order to get the ball bouncing along the paddles so I decided to drop it due to time constraints and work on building it within 2D instead.
