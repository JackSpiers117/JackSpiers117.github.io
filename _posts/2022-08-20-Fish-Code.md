I was working on ideas with my code when while working on developing my skills making if statements and variable moving shapes I developed the idea of making a swimming fish, such as below:

Now this was a rough draft of the moving fish, I wanted to mess around specifically with the triangle shape, as I was curious how I could utilise the draw and framecounts of the canvas to develop an animation through code, it was a simple swoosh of the tail but it was enough for me to make a cartoon swimming fish, so I grabbed my code and put it into another editor to work on the real result of the tail that I want to place into my p5 sketch, an optimised version essentially. TL;DR here is the result.

It was essentially just optimising from there, adding in the fish assets like the body and eye followed to create the final fish design and edited how harshly the fish flailed its tail.
